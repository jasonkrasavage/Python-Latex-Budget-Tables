This application requires basic python and command line skills, but does not require knowledge of the LaTeX programming language. If you need any help setting up and using this application, please email me at jason.krasavage@loop.colum.edu. 

Budget Tables is a python script that utilizes Perl, LaTeX, pdfCropMargins, and the PyLatex module together to programmatically generate and crop LaTeX style tables in PDF format. 

The budgeting itself, although very simple, is for the user who wants to know the net worth of their bank account if they were to take into account the things they plan to buy and the money they plan to make.

I use this application to get a better understanding, at a quick glance, of where my finances really stand. I hope you can put it to some use in your own daily life. 

This project is open source. Feel free to use the code anywhere you like, crediting the GitHub repository. If you work this application into your own project, I would absolutely love to take a look, so please email me!
